Accra RUG is an Accra-based community for anyone interested in the Ruby programming language, both beginners and experts.

ARUG provides opportunities to:

- Discuss Ruby and related topics
- Socialise with friendly people who are interested in Ruby
- Find or fill Ruby-related jobs

We want ARUG to be a diverse and inclusive community, united by an interest in Ruby, and so we want anyone who is interested in Ruby to be able to participate.
