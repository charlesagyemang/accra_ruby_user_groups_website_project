### Code of Conduct
It’s of primary importance that everyone who wants to participate feels safe and welcome. When participating in ARUG, either online or offline, we expect you to:

- Behave respectfully towards other people — they’re real humans, just like you
- Be considerate of people’s time and attention
- Contribute positively and constructively to discussions (online or in-person)
- Lead by example — if a discussion is devolving into snark and name-calling, either let it die or raise the tone
- Keep standards high — if someone acts disrespectfully, make that crystal clear to them

We want everyone to feel welcome at ARUG, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Accordingly, we will not tolerate harassment of our members in any form; not at the talks, after the talks, or any other ARUG social meeting; not on Twitter or on any other online media.
